# belly-button-challenge
Repo for Module 14 Assignment

This repo contains the Reedme file, the html from which the code is launched, the original sample data in a json file, the gitignore and the static folder that contains the gitkeep file and the app.js file where the javascript code was done. 

I did not do the bonus ask so I commented out the code in the html that would link to the js file that would have the bonus code. 

This is the link to the GitPages to view tha app: https://katyoung91.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
